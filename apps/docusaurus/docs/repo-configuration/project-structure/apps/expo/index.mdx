# Expo Application

:::tip
The `apps/expo` folder can be safely deleted if you are not using Expo in your project. It is included to demonstrate how
to set up multiple apps within the same monorepo.
:::

This is the mobile application of the monorepo, built with Expo and React Native. Like the `nextjs` folder, it's named after the primary technology it uses for clear identification.

## Application Structure

The Expo application is organized as follows:

```
apps/expo/
├── assets/           # Images, fonts, and other static assets
├── src/
│   ├── app/          # Expo Router structure
│   │   ├── _layout.tsx  # Root layout 
│   │   ├── index.tsx    # Home screen
│   │   └── post/        # Post-related screens
│   ├── utils/         # Utility functions
│   └── styles.css     # Global styles (with Tailwind)
```

## Features

- **Expo SDK 51**
