# Set up Docusaurus

## Set up the Config

In `apps/docusaurus/docusaurus.config.ts` you can set the documentation config.

For example you can update the `title`, `tagline` and `favicon` to appropriate values for the project.

Near the bottom of the config you can also set the `themeConfig`'s `title` and `logo` which show in the nav bar in Docusaurus, and update the GitHub link in the `themeConfig.navbar.items` array.

See [How to use Docusaurus](./how-to-use-docusaurus.md) for info on how to create and structure your documentation.
