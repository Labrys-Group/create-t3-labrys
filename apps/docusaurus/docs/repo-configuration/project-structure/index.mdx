# Project Structure

:::info Project Structure Overview
This monorepo is organized into three main sections:

- **Apps**: The main applications (Next.js, Expo, and Documentation). This is where you would put a new application (eg. admin dashboard).
- **Packages**: Shared libraries and utilities used across apps.
- **Tooling**: Configuration files and development tools.

Browse through the sections below to learn more about each part.
:::

:::caution Strict Code Organization
This monorepo follows a strict code organization pattern where each piece of functionality belongs in its specific location:

- **API code** (tRPC routers, procedures) must only be placed in the `packages/api` package
- **Database models and queries** must only be placed in the `packages/db` package
- **Shared UI components** (including shadcn/ui components) must only be placed in the `packages/ui` package
- **Authentication logic** must only be placed in the `packages/auth` package

Maintaining this separation ensures proper code reuse across applications, prevents duplication, and makes the codebase more maintainable.
:::

:::tip
The `apps/expo` folder can be safely deleted if you are not using Expo in your project. It is included to demonstrate how
to set up multiple apps within the same monorepo.

## Configuration Directories

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    └── CI with pnpm cache setup

.vscode/
└── Recommended extensions and settings for VSCode/Cursor users
```

These directories contain configuration for GitHub workflows and VS Code:

- **.github**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD pipelines
- **.vscode**: Contains workspace settings and recommended extensions for VS Code and Cursor users

import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";
import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

## Apps

The main applications in the repo.

```
apps/
├── expo/             # Mobile application
│   ├── Expo SDK 51
│   ├── React Native using React 18
│   ├── Navigation using Expo Router
│   ├── Tailwind using NativeWind
│   └── Typesafe API calls using tRPC
│
├── documentation/    # Documentation site
│   └── Docusaurus site for project documentation
│
└── nextjs/           # Web application
    ├── Next.js 14
    ├── React 18
    ├── Tailwind CSS
    └── E2E Typesafe API Server & Client
```

### App Naming Conventions

The apps in this monorepo follow a simple naming convention based on the technology they use:

#### `apps/nextjs`

This is your main web application built with Next.js. It's named "nextjs" to clearly indicate the framework being used, making it easier to understand the technology stack at a glance. This naming convention is particularly helpful in monorepos where you might have multiple web applications using different frameworks.

#### `apps/expo`

This is your mobile application built with Expo and React Native. Again, it's named after the primary technology it uses.

#### `apps/docusaurus`

This is a Docusaurus site that contains this documentation.

<DocCardList
  items={
    useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.find((item) => item.label === "Apps")
      ?.items || []
  }
/>

## Packages

Shared packages used by the main applications. These packages contain code that needs to be used across multiple apps, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

```
packages/
├── api/              # API layer
│   └── tRPC v11 router definition and ALL API related code
│
├── auth/             # Authentication
│   └── Authentication using next-auth
│
├── db/               # Database
│   └── Typesafe db calls using Typegoose & MongoDB
│
└── ui/               # User interface
    └── Start of a UI package for the webapp using shadcn-ui
```

<DocCardList
  items={
    useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.find((item) => item.label === "Packages")
      ?.items || []
  }
/>

## Tooling

Shared development tools and configurations. These ensure consistent code style, quality, and behavior across all apps and packages in the monorepo.

```
tooling/
├── eslint/           # Shared ESLint configurations
│   └── shared, fine-grained, eslint presets
│
├── prettier/         # Shared Prettier configurations
│   └── shared prettier configuration
│
├── tailwind/         # Shared Tailwind CSS configurations
│   └── shared tailwind configuration
│
└── typescript/       # Shared TypeScript configurations
    └── shared tsconfig you can extend from
```

These tooling packages provide:

- **Consistent Code Style**: Through shared ESLint and Prettier configurations
- **Unified UI Framework**: With shared Tailwind CSS configuration
- **Type Safety**: With shared TypeScript configurations
- **Developer Experience**: Common configurations reduce setup time for new apps
