:::note
This document provides an overview of the database setup. For detailed information on the database package implementation, please refer to the [Database Package](/docs/repo-configuration/project-structure/packages/db) documentation.

## Overview

This repo uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database. The MongoDB implementation is provided through the `@project-name/db` package.

## Key Features

- Type-safe MongoDB models using Typegoose
- Connection management for both raw MongoDB access and Mongoose ODM
- Database schema definitions with validation
- Docker configuration for local MongoDB development

## Getting Started

To start using the database:

1. Configure the MongoDB connection in your `.env` file:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
   ```

2. For local development with Docker, run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f packages/db/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

## Hot Reloading Limitation

:::warning
Currently during local development the database package will not hot reload when the schema changes. This means that you will need to restart the Next.js server to see the changes.
