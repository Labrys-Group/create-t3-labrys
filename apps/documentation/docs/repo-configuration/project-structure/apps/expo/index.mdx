# Expo

:::tip

The `apps/expo` folder can be safely deleted if you are not using Expo in your project. It is included to demonstrate how
to set up multiple apps within the same monorepo.

:::

The Expo app is set up with the following:

- Expo SDK 51
- React Native with React 18
- Navigation using Expo Router
- Tailwind using NativeWind
- Typesafe API calls using tRPC

import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";
import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
