# MDX

Docusaurus has built-in support for [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which allows you to write JSX within your Markdown files and render them as React components.

Check out the [MDX docs](https://mdxjs.com/) to see what fancy stuff you can do with MDX.

### Exporting components

To define any custom component within an MDX file, you have to export it: only paragraphs that start with `export` will be parsed as components instead of prose.

```jsx
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!
```

Notice how it renders both the markup from your React component and the Markdown syntax:

```mdx-code-block
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<><Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight>
{` `}and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.</>

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!
```

## Importing components

:::warning[TODO]

Work out how to import components from other packages in the monorepo.

## Importing code snippets

You can not only import a file containing a component definition, but also import any code file as raw text, and then insert it in a code block, thanks to [Webpack raw-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/raw-loader/). You can import code snippets from another file as it is:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```jsx title="myMarkdownFile.mdx"
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/components/myComponent';

<CodeBlock language="jsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>
```

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/components/myComponent';

<CodeBlock language="jsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>
```

:::note

See [User](../../../docs/models/user.mdx) for an example of importing from another package in the monorepo.
