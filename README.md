# create-t3-turbo-mongo

## Installation

There are two ways of initializing an app using the `create-t3-turbo-mongo` starter. You can either use this repository as a template, or use Turbo's CLI to init your project (use PNPM as package manager):

```bash
npx create-turbo@latest -e https://github.com/Labrys-Group/create-t3-turbo-mongo
```

## Quick Start (Without Expo)

To get it running, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Configure environment variables
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Delete the Expo Project

```bash
rm -rf apps/expo
```

### 3. Run the Web App

```bash
cd apps/nextjs
pnpm dev
```

## Quick Start (With Expo)

To get it running, follow the steps below:

### 1. Setup dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Configure environment variables
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Configure Expo `dev`-script

#### Use iOS Simulator

1. Make sure you have XCode and XCommand Line Tools installed [as shown on expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator).

   > **NOTE:** If you just installed XCode, or if you have updated it, you need to open the simulator manually once. Run `npx expo start` from `apps/expo`, and then enter `I` to launch Expo Go. After the manual launch, you can run `pnpm dev` in the root directory.

   ```diff
   +  "dev": "expo start --ios",
   ```

2. Run `pnpm dev` at the project root folder.

#### Use Android Emulator

1. Install Android Studio tools [as shown on expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator).

2. Change the `dev` script at `apps/expo/package.json` to open the Android emulator.

   ```diff
   +  "dev": "expo start --android",
   ```

3. Run `pnpm dev` at the project root folder.

### 3. Configuring Next-Auth to work with Expo

In order to get Next-Auth to work with Expo, you must either:

#### Deploy the Auth Proxy (RECOMMENDED)

In [apps/auth-proxy](./apps/auth-proxy) you can find a Nitro server that proxies OAuth requests. By deploying this and setting the `AUTH_REDIRECT_PROXY_URL` environment variable to the URL of this proxy, you can get OAuth working in preview deployments and development for Expo apps. See more deployment instructions in the [auth proxy README](./apps/auth-proxy/README.md).

By using the proxy server, the Next.js apps will forward any auth requests to the proxy server, which will handle the OAuth flow and then redirect back to the Next.js app. This makes it easy to get OAuth working since you'll have a stable URL that is publically accessible and doesn't change for every deployment and doesn't rely on what port the app is running on. So if port 3000 is taken and your Next.js app starts at port 3001 instead, your auth should still work without having to reconfigure the OAuth provider.

#### Add your local IP to your OAuth provider

You can alternatively add your local IP (e.g. `192.168.x.y:$PORT`) to your OAuth provider. This may not be as reliable as your local IP may change when you change networks. Some OAuth providers may also only support a single callback URL for each app making this approach unviable for some providers (e.g. GitHub).

### 4a. When it's time to add a new UI component

Run the `ui-add` script to add a new UI component using the interactive `shadcn/ui` CLI:

```bash
pnpm ui-add
```

When the component(s) has been installed, you should be good to go and start using it in your app.

### 4b. When it's time to add a new package

To add a new package, simply run `pnpm turbo gen init` in the monorepo root. This will prompt you for a package name as well as if you want to install any dependencies to the new package (of course you can also do this yourself later).

The generator sets up the `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` and a `index.ts`, as well as configures all the necessary configurations for tooling around your package such as formatting, linting and typechecking. When the package is created, you're ready to go build out the package.
